# 0. First time?

No, this is not the first time I tried to learn Japanese. Back in my sophomore year in university, I had already thought about learning Japanese as a required foreign language in order to graduate, and I did study quite hard and got a N5 level certificate, and with a reasonably decent mark.

But since then, I have strayed away from the path of learning, and have not touched Japanese seriously. Sometimes I tried to learn some kanji characters to get myself interested again, but all those attempts ended up in failure. I believe what I did wrong is that I have not kept a consistent effort for learning Japanese, as well as many other things. That's why I kept failing and failing in life.

All the previous times I tried to get back into learning Japanese, I did with the hope that I will get motivated again, and later on days when I fell into depression, or into a needless indulgence, the hope died. This time, I don't hope to get motivated anymore. I'm done with motivation, it gets me nowhere. Instead, I decided to write everything I learn about Japanese on this blog. Everything. And although it is unlikely that people online will follow this journey of mine, the tiny possibility that someone might be reading keeps me accountable.

Also, I apologize to that one person that stumbles upon this dumpyard of words and symbols. I am not good with writing in English. Hell, I suck at writing in my native language. Please forgive me for any unnatural phrases that I might put here. If I keep writing a lot more, I might gradually get better though.

# 1. Prelearning speculation

All I remember about Japanese now is that: the most important part of a sentence is the verb. The subject may not be there, the object might not be there, but the verb can't be missing. Also when a sentence is completely written out, it follows the format of Subject - Object - Verb.

Another thing is that Japanese is a high context language. That means a lot of information is inferred from the context the language is used in.

And that Japanese is written in three types of script: Hiragana, Katakana, and Kanji. Yeah, that's about all I still retain after years of neglect. Hope that I will get the brain juice back in no time haha.

# 2. The learning

The lessons are from Taekim's guide to japanese.

Alright, the first lesson is nothing much, just a basic introduction to Japanese sentence with the most basic kind of all, a state of being sentence. My problem about taking this lesson though, is that I procrastinated and pushed off two thirds of a week before picking it up.

The most simple sentence (state-of-being declaration) consists of a noun, or an adjective, followed by だ (pronounced da in English), that's it. Actually, the だ isn't even needed, it's just here to make the declaration more emphatic. I read that there are more functions to it in other context, but I won't bother myself with it yet.

For negative state-if-being, the だ is conjugated into じゃあない (janai), for past, it's だった　(datta), and for negative past, じゃなかった (janakatta). This is interesting as it implied that Japanese have 2 tenses, past and non-past, which constrasts with languages like English, with a gazillion tenses. Maybe it is the high-context nature of Japanese that allows its grammar much simpler.

The lesson comes with a few exercises and a number of Kanji and vocabulary words. So... Anki might be useful to remember all that.

# 3. What? I was wrong.

In my presumption before the lesson, I stated that the verb is the essential part of the sentence, but no, in the simplest sentence there is no verbs (だ is not a verb). The essential part of Japanese sentence is actually the predicate, with conveys all the remaining needed information that the context doesn't carry.
